    Andee "uhh, thanks?"
    "Reo gives an awkward smile and a thumbs up"
    Haddie "No seriously, thank you for choosing our amazing university, but since you two are already running late.. I'll keep our little introduction short and just go over some of the more significant rules here on Campus."

    Andee "(Ah right.. rules)"
    Andee "(I'm good at following those, I think...)"

    Haddie "First, punctuality is paramount. Classes, meetings, events… this school does not wait for stragglers." 

    "She gives a sharp glance at Reo and you can basically feel all of his earlier confidence melt away."

    Haddie "Second, respect. To your professors, to your peers, to the traditions of Hibana."


    Haddie "As you may already know, this island is sacred. Those who reside here do not tolerate disrespect, toward themselves, or toward their land."
    Haddie "Any Violations to the laws of Hibana Island will result in Instant Removal from our university and the island itself"
    "You can only nod quietly.."
    Haddie "Consequences for disrespect are… contextual. You’ll know when you’ve crossed the line."
    Andee "U-understood ma’am.."
    Haddie "Third, boundaries. Certain areas of this campus, and this island, are strictly off-limits. I expect you to remember that… for your own safety."
    Haddie "If you have any questions about restricted areas just ask either me or one of our wonderful staff members. But for the most part it should be fairly obvious, as we have signs set around all restricted areas."
    Andee "(that shouldn't be so har-)"

    Haddie "there is one area… deep within the forest that surrounds our campus that you are absolutely NOT prohibited to trespass.."
    Andee  "I-"
    Haddie "Island natives call it Yomi no Kuni. Once you step foot there… There is no saying what can happen. Our security lines do not reach that far. You will no longer be under our responsibility. We have lost many students from failure to follow that one rule. So be warned."
    Andee "(I think the color just completely drained from my face...)"
    Haddie "*Ahem*"
    # [Music Dream Butterfly.mp3]
    Haddie "And lastly… conduct. We maintain an environment of excellence here. One stain on this university’s reputation, and you will find yourself on the next ferry home."
    "She straightens a stack of papers, her voice softening for just a moment as her eyes flick back to you."
    Haddie "Abide by these, and your time at Ikigai will be… enlightening."
    Andee "U-Understood"
    Andee "(Those shouldn't be too hard to follow… so why am i shaking?...)"
    Andee "(Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong just being here…)"
